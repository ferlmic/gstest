## Description

R version of Statistics Canada's (StatCan) generalized system **G-Series** initially developed in SAS^®^. This website is devoted to G-Series in R (package gstest). Email us at [g-series@statcan.gc.ca](mailto:g-series@statcan.gc.ca) for information about the SAS^®^ versions. 

> _**Note - StatCan intranet**_\
> StatCan employees can also visit the G-Series Confluence page on the agency's intranet (search for "G-Series | G-Séries" in Confluence) as well as the G-Series GitLab development project also hosted on the agency's intranet (search for "G-Series in R - G-Séries en R" in GitLab). The latter includes a version of the information and instructions contained on this page that are specific to the StatCan IT infrastructure (e.g., Artifactory and GitLab); see file `index_StatCan.md` in the GitLab project root folder.

G-Series 3.0 (package gstest 3.0.0) is the initial open-source version of the software. It includes the rewriting in R of all SAS^®^ G<span>&#8209;</span>Series 2.0 functionalities, that is PROC BENCHMARKING, PROC TSRAKING and macro _**GSeriesTSBalancing**_ along with a function for benchmarking *stocks* using a spline interpolation approach where the spline knots correspond to the benchmark-to-indicator ratios or differences. It includes the following *core functions*:

* `benchmarking()`
* `stock_benchmarking()`
* `tsraking()`, `tsraking_driver()`
* `tsbalancing()` <br>
  
Other *utility functions* are also included with the package. Visit the [Reference](./reference/index.html) page (top bar) for the complete list of available functions. 


## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Release version from CRAN 
# (coming soon...)
#install.packages("gstest")

# Development version from GitHub
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ferlmic/gstest")

# A specific release version from GitHub
remotes::install_github("ferlmic/gstest@<release-tag>")
```
where *\<release-tag\>* refers to values listed under the GitHub project  [Tags](https://github.com/ferlmic/gstest/tags) ($\geq$ *v3.0.0*).

#### *Alternative*
The package can also be installed from the downloaded source files. This approach requires the prior installation of the packages on which gstest depends (because of `repos = NULL` in the `install.packages()` call).

1. Access the relevant GitHub [repository](https://github.com/ferlmic/gstest) (*main* branch or tag $\geq$ *v3.0.0*)
2. Download the repository files (*Code* > *Download ZIP*)
3. Decompress the downloaded repository files
4. Install the gstest package (and its dependent packages):
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "ggtext", "gridExtra", "lifecycle", "osqp", "rlang", "xmpdf"))
install.packages("<name & path of the decompressed downloaded repository files>",
                 repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

#### _Vignettes_
Installing gstest from CRAN (`install.packages("gstest")`) automatically builds and installs the package vignettes. However, this is not the case by default when installing a package from GitHub (with `remotes::install_github()`) or from its downloaded source files (with `install.packages(..., repos = NULL, type = "source")`). Although vignettes are not necessary for a package to be functional, they contain useful complementary documentation. The gstest package vignettes are available under the _**Articles**_ drop-down menu (top bar) of this website and in the `pdf/` folder of the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/ferlmic/gstest). Installing vignettes with the package makes them accessible from within R as well (e.g., with `browseVignettes("gstest")` or `vignette("<vignette-name>")`). 

Building the gstest package vignettes requires the (free) [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) software, which is included in [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/), and a LaTeX distribution (e.g., [TinyTex](https://github.com/rstudio/tinytex-releases)). You should therefore avoid trying to build the gstest package vignettes with the basic R GUI (unless you have a standalone installation of Pandoc) or without a working LaTeX distribution. Building vignettes also requires R packages knitr and rmarkdown.

When installing **from GitHub**, use argument `build_vignettes = TRUE`:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("knitr", "remotes", "rmarkdown"))
remotes::install_github("ferlmic/gstest", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

When installing **from the downloaded source files**, build the *bundle package* first with `devtools::build()`:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("devtools", "ggplot2", "ggtext", "gridExtra", "osqp", "xmpdf"))
bndl_pkg_path <- devtools::build("<name & path of the decompressed downloaded repository files>")
install.packages(bndl_pkg_path, repos = NULL, type = "source")
```
Note: packages knitr, lifecycle, rlang and rmarkdown are automatically installed with devtools.


## Documentation
The bilingual (French-English) gstest package documentation available in this website is also accessible from within R (in English only). `help("gstest")` in R displays general package information including a link (the URL) to this website. Clicking the **Index** link at the bottom of the gstest package help page in RStudio (or with `help(package = "gstest")`) displays a list of all the documentation elements available for the package, including:

* topic/function help pages (top bar's [Reference](./reference/index.html) page);
* vignettes, when installed (top bar's ***Articles*** drop-down menu);
* package news ([Changelog](./news/index.html) page under the top bar's ***News*** drop-down menu).

The individual function help pages found in the [Reference](./reference/index.html) page (top bar) can be accessed directly in R with `help("<function-name>")`. They contain comprehensive information about each function including useful examples and will be you primary source of information. The vignettes found under the ***Articles*** drop-down menu (top bar) are a complementary source of information that, when installed with the package, can also be accessed from within R with `browseVignettes("gstest")` or `vignette("<vignette-name>")`. They include: 

* a *Benchmarking CookBook* (`vignette("benchmarking-cookbook")`) going through the steps of a typical benchmarking project;
* *A Beginner's Benchmarking Demo Script* (`vignette("benchmarking-demo-script")`) illustrating the usage of the benchmarking functions in a practical context;
* a *OSQP Settings Sequence Data Frame* page (`vignette("osqp-settings-sequence-dataframe")`) describing the *solving sequence* implemented in `tsbalancing()` and explaining how it can be customized.

Finally, the [Get started](./articles/gstest.html) page (top bar) provides general information about G-Series and is available as a vignette in R (`vignette("gstest")`).

#### *Local copy of the package website*
The `docs/` folder of the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/ferlmic/gstest) (*main* branch or tag $\geq$ *v3.0.0*) contains the package website files and can therefore be downloaded to obtain a local copy of this website. This can be useful for offline consultation or for accessing the documentation of a specific version of the package (e.g., the development version or an earlier release). After having downloaded (*Code* > *Download ZIP*) and decompressed the repository files, open file `docs/en/index.html` in a web browser to access the local copy of the (current) home page. Alternatively, one can use GitHub tool [Download GitHub directory](https://download-directory.github.io/) and download only the contents of the `docs/` folder instead of the entire repository:

1. Open the `docs/` folder of the relevant GitHub [repository](https://github.com/ferlmic/gstest) (*main* branch or tag $\geq$ *v3.0.0*).
2. Copy the folder URL (address bar) in the [Download GitHub directory](https://download-directory.github.io/) tool's text field and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. 
3. Decompress the downloaded directory.
4. Open file `en/index.html` in a web browser.

Note: the *Search for* box (top bar) is not functional in local copies of the package website.

#### *PDF format*
G-Series documentation in PDF format, also useful for offline consultation or for a specific version of G-Series, is available in the `pdf/` folder of the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/ferlmic/gstest) (*main* branch or tag $\geq$ *v3.0.0* for the R versions and tag $\leq$ *v2.0* for the SAS^®^ versions). Again, GitHub tool [Download GitHub directory](https://download-directory.github.io/) can be used to download the contents of the `pdf/` folder instead of the entire repository. Decompressing the downloaded directory will then unveil the individual PDF files.
